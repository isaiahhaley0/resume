Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Quality Engineer position listed on the Costco Careers website. With a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science from CU Denver, a solid foundation in software engineering principles, and hands-on experience in developing software solutions, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Costco's technology initiatives.

While at CU Denver, and at my current position with Covius, I developed and honed my skills with C#, SQL, and python, which I believe make me well aligned with Costco's technology stack. A key project that I helped develop while at CU Denver was a CPR training application, that was developed in conjuction with a local doctor, and won my schools engineering competition. While developing the application, for which I wrote most of the backend using C#/.net to implement a MQTT connection to a sensor developed by a group of BioMedical engineering studends as well as the algorithm to analyze the data received from the sensor for feedback to the user of the application, I gained a new appreciation for gathering feedback from users early in the development process. During my time at Covius, I have helped develop and maintain email tools that enable our billing operations team to efficently and reliably manage the delivery and tracking of billing and collections emails, as well as several business automations, written in c#/.net, using Selenium and Autoit, that have led to a reduction in manual effort, errors and a faster throughput for the processes in question, which has led to several hundered thousand dollars in cost savings for the company. For many of these projects, I was responsible for every step in the software development life cycle, creating every aspect of the application by myself, designing the UI, database, and backend processes. These experiences instilled in me the importance of developing user-centric solutions that align with business goals, a principle I understand Costco values highly.

Costco's commitment to leveraging technology for enhancing operational efficiency and improving customer experience resonates with my professional ethos. I am particulary drawn to Costco due to the innovative use of technology across the business, such as the use of RFID tags to track products through your supply chain, as well as the way the company uses data analytics to gain insight into consumer shopping behaviors and trends. 

On a personaal level, I am drawn to Costco due to the fact that Costco has shown a commitment to being a responsible and ethical part of society. I beleive costco is well positioned to be a part of a sustainable society by leveraging its efficent logistics and encouraging high volume sales to help reduce the carbon footprint of consumer purchases.  

I am enthusiastic about the chance to contribute to Costco's continued success by developing robust, efficient, and innovative software solutions. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills, experience, and passions align with the needs of your team.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to learn more about this opportunity and discuss how I can contribute to your team. I am available at your convenience for an interview.

Sincerly,

Isaiah Haley
